### HEY FOLKS :wave: :wave:
<p>
I am a student at Chandigarh College of Engineering And Technology pursuing my bachelor's in Computer Science interested in fusion of Web Development and Artificial Intelligence. Currently, exploring the field of Deep Learning.  
I love to interact with new people and to get the insights on how they choose their career paths.I love to try new things even if I don't get success as it is my belief to be successfully exponentially we need to fail sometimes greatly!! 
I love to play football and quite fond of movies, especially sci-fi.
